The modules of this directory are used to prepair and analyse the forward Lagrangian 
calculations conducted with TRACZILLA from the top of convective clouds to defined
layers in the TTL.

prepback:
(derived from the packages used to prepair backward runs in STC-back)
    
prepack packages prepair part_000 files used to start the forward integration. 
These files contain the initial location (lon, lat, p, T) and launch times of 
the parcels that are integrated forward. 

The input is the PTOP files generated by merging the SAFNWC product for Himawari
and MSG1. It contains the top pressure (CTTH product) on a projection grid of 
resolution 0.1° x 0.1°, plus (on the most recent version) a status flag of  
the cloud (good and opaq). 
The PTOP files are generated by  compositMHi.py (STC-SAFNWC) on the ICARE center.

In the first version based on the 2013 version of the SAFNWC product, the pressures 
are discretized by 25 hPa steps. prepback4.py is made for this version and produces
temperatures interpolated from ECMWF analysis at the location of the cloud tops.
This version has not been used since MSG1 has been converted to 2016 version of 
SAFNWC by mid May 2017.

In the new version, the values are not discretized and the interpolation of 
temperature cannot be done only on the discretized levels.
prepback5N.py performs the interpolation for each cloud top.
The status of the cloud is written in the flag field of part_000 with is written
using 107 format. 

A cut-off is applied on top cloud pressure, selecting only clouds with top pressure
less than 175 hPa.

The PTOP pressure is sampled every hour.

prepack5.py is an early version of prepback5N.py used to prepair files with 
an hybrid version of PTOP.
